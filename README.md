# NetSuite Sticky Header
Always see the primary record header (Customer or Order) in NetSuite. Keeps the current record's key details visible as you scroll.

Are you tired of constantly scrolling back up in NetSuite just to remind yourself which Customer, Sales Order, Vendor Bill, or Case you are currently viewing? We know the frustration of losing context when dealing with long forms and detailed transaction records.

Introducing the must-have Chrome extension that completely transforms how you interact with NetSuite records!

###The Problem Solved: Context Loss is History!
NetSuite records often contain extensive detail, forcing you to scroll far down the page. When you reach the financial tabs or related items sections, the crucial primary record header—the ID, the name, or the primary status—disappears off the top of the screen. This forces you to either memorize the key details or constantly waste time scrolling back up, disrupting your focus and slowing down your entire process.

###The Solution: Uninterrupted Visibility
This powerful, yet simple, extension implements a sticky primary record header feature, mimicking the best practices of modern web design.

###What it Does: 
It makes the entire primary information bar at the top of records (the one showing the record type, internal ID, and main title, like "Customer: John Doe (CUST1234)") remain anchored to the top of your browser window.

###The Benefit: 
As you scroll down to review line items, notes, or related transactions, the essential information stays perfectly visible. You will always know exactly which customer, order, or item you are working on, at all times.
