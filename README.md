# 📌 NetSuite Sticky Header: Never Lose Context Again

Always keep the **primary record header** (Customer, Sales Order, Bill, Case, etc.) visible as you scroll down any long NetSuite form. Keeps the current record's key details anchored to the top of your screen.

---

## 😫 The Problem: Context Loss

NetSuite records often require extensive scrolling to reach financial tabs, line items, or related transactions. Once you scroll past the top, the crucial primary record header—containing the ID, name, or primary status—**disappears**.

This forces you to:
* Constantly scroll back up, **wasting time** and **breaking focus**.
* Attempt to memorize key details, increasing the chance of **data entry errors**.

## ✨ The Solution: Uninterrupted Visibility

This powerful, yet simple, Chrome extension transforms how you interact with NetSuite records.

### How It Works:
The extension implements a **sticky primary record header** feature, mimicking the best practices of modern web design.

It anchors the entire primary information bar (e.g., "Customer: John Doe (CUST1234)" or "Sales Order #SO12345") to the **top of your browser window**.

### ✅ The Benefit: Instant Efficiency

As you scroll to review notes, line items, or related transactions, the essential record information stays **perfectly visible**.

You will **always** know exactly which customer, order, or item you are working on, at all times, leading to:
* **Faster** record processing.
* **Reduced** mental load and frustration.
* **Improved** data accuracy.
